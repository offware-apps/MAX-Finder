# Trip flow redesign — working notes

Living design doc for the round-trip / day-trip rework and the surrounding UX fixes.
Captures the decisions made with David so they survive across sessions. Not final —
updated as the audit lands and choices are confirmed.

## Guiding principles (non-negotiable)

1. **Intuitive and easy above all.** A first-time user should understand each screen
   without thinking. Every design choice is measured against that.
2. **Zero truncated text on mobile — anywhere.** No station name, chip, duration,
   count, or header may be clipped at 390px. Text wraps and fits; it is never cut off.
3. Durable > clever: the app is a power-user tool, but never at the cost of 1 or 2.

## The trip flow: two intents, one surface

The redesign collapses the separate **Day trip** and **Round trip** modes into a single
flow, focused on the **destination and how much time you can spend there**. It serves
two distinct user intents:

- **Duration-first** — *"I have N days (or a day) — where can I go?"* You know the time
  budget and want destinations. → origin-only **discovery**, ranked by time at the
  destination.
- **Commitment-first** — *"I'm going there — when can I come back?"* You know the place
  and the departure and want the return.

`0 days = same day` is simply the shortest case of the same flow (there and back today →
shown as **hours on site**); `1 / 2 / 3+ days` = nights there.

### The two calendars, reframed by role (so neither feels duplicated)

The "duplicated calendar" feeling came from the **outbound** calendar re-asking a date
already set in the form. But the outbound calendar isn't pure duplication — its real
value is **hopping the departure to another day by tapping**, and seeing which days even
have seats. So we keep it, but reframe it:

- **Outbound → a compact "your departure" quick-switch strip.** Tap a green day to
  *move* the trip; availability at a glance. Reads as a switcher, not a second date
  question. Mirrors the form date, doesn't re-ask it.
- **Return → the fuller "when can you come back?" calendar.** The real decision. Each
  return day shows a real return and implies how many days/nights you'd get there.
- **Same-day** → no return calendar (you come back today → hours on site).
- **Origin only** → duration-first discovery: "with this much time, here's where you
  can go", ranked by time at destination. Never a dead-end.

### Efficiency, not casual (David: "I don't like the weekend / next week… it's casual,
### I want efficiency")

- Drop the casual window-preset chips ("This weekend / Next 7 days / This month"). Use the
  **same efficient date + number-of-days controls** as the rest of the flow, so discovery
  and a concrete trip share one mental model. No cute presets; direct controls.
- If any of this still lags on weak devices, the **low-end setting** (Settings → low-end
  mode) must cover it — that's the escape hatch, per the constitution.

### Interaction

- **Departure date is chosen once** (form / the departure strip mirrors it).
- **When trains are selected, the calendar collapses** out of the way — not left sitting
  there as a duplicate after you've chosen.
- Legacy `?rdate=` / `?rt=` deep links keep working.

> way you think"). I'll bring ONE concrete proposal to react to before the big build.

## UX fixes batch (not controversial — implement directly)

From David's testing on a real phone:

1. **Zero-truncation sweep (crucial).** Every `text-overflow: ellipsis` /
   `white-space: nowrap` / fixed-width label in `styles.css` + the render layouts.
   Verify at 390px with long names (Saint-Pierre-des-Corps, Aix-en-Provence TGV…).
2. **Map hidden under the drawer.** `fitBounds` fits markers to the full map height, but
   the bottom-sheet drawer covers ~55% on mobile, so destinations (southern France) sit
   under the drawer. Add drawer-aware bottom padding to `fitBounds`
   (`src/ui/map.ts` `show()` / `route()`).
3. **Truncated destination names in list cards.** The hours-on-site + count chips eat the
   width, squeezing the name to "Arr…", "Le Creus…". Give the name priority; wrap chips.
   (`getawayCityRowEl` / `groupCardEl` in `src/ui/render.ts` + CSS.)
4. **Auto-scroll on below-fold updates.** Tapping a date / week chip filters the list but
   gives no visible feedback on mobile. Auto-scroll the drawer to reveal the updated
   results — and anywhere content updates below the fold (date pick, filter change, leg
   hand-off).
5. **Dead "MAX Finder" back-nav screen.** Returning on mobile lands on the search-bar
   placeholder + an armed prompt with nothing useful. Show something real instead.
6. **State reset on navigation.** Opening another page (saved trips, favorites, a
   drill-in) and coming back resets the main form + search. Preserve it.
7. **Find & remove all duplicated actions** (the audit's main job).

## Already shipped this cycle (on `main` unless noted)

- Round-trip redesign v1 (One-way / Day trip / Round trip) — the version being reworked.
- Low-end master toggle + one-time slow-device nudge; app-update postcard.
- "Surprise me" in the custom-legs editor.
- Browse freeze fix: per-candidate DFS → one-pass sweep (15 s → ~0.1 s).
- Search compute moved to a background worker (main-thread blocking ~3–5× lower).
- Incremental (chunked) rendering of long result lists. *(pushed, not yet in a PR)*

## Audit results (concrete plan)

The audit found everything traces to **3 root causes**:

1. **Duplication** — two save systems (favorite star + Save bookmark); day-trip and
   round-trip are the *same* 2-leg accordion forked by one `isDay` boolean; three
   divergent "open a route" handlers (`onOpenRoute` runs, `fillRoute` prefills,
   `selectStation` highlights); the outbound date collected in the form field **and**
   re-asked as a Leg-1 calendar; the availability calendar rendered in both the form
   popover and the results.
2. **Dead screens + state reset** — the mobile screen is chosen by
   `setMobileForm(!store.urlHasQuery())`, but `urlHasQuery()` is *always* true
   (`queryToParams` always writes `mode`), so Back/reload to an origin-less query forces
   the results view onto `runArmedPrompt`/`showHint`, which set an empty title → the bar
   falls back to the "MAX Finder" placeholder. And `goBack` restores the last *searched*
   query via `syncFormFromQuery`, wiping staged (un-searched) form edits.
3. **Mobile discovery** — `fitBounds` uses a uniform pad with no knowledge of the ~30vh
   drawer (pins hide under the sheet); the 3-item non-wrapping `.dest-meta` row truncates
   names; `refreshInPlace` saves/restores `window.scrollY` but results live in
   `.drawer-scroll`, so a date/chip tap updates silently below the fold.

### Ticket flow refinement (David, brainstorm — "something like that")

- A **direct / one-way trip** is booked from the **right-side button** (the arrow/book button),
  NOT a whole-card tap — as it was originally. Don't make the whole card book.
- A one-way result carries **no "Do you want to come back?" button**: it repeated the
  form's **Round trip** toggle, which stays the one way to add the return.
- David likes selecting the **precise return date directly** on the calendar in round trip —
  keep the linked-calendar direct date pick.
- To refine on the REAL screen after the current build lands (concrete > abstract).

### Booking must be OBVIOUS (David: "this is really cool but how can I access my ticket?")

Once both legs are chosen (✓ Aller / ✓ Retour recap), the only booking affordance is a bare
`>` arrow — users don't know it books. Give each leg a clear labelled action ("Réserver
l'aller" / "Réserver le retour", i.e. Book this leg) that deep-links to SNCF Connect, and/or
a prominent combined "Réserver" — so getting the ticket is unmistakable. This is the ticket
flow the audit flagged (#4).

### Refined build direction (David, latest)

**The possible-days calendar stays — but hides by default once a date is chosen.**
- Seeing all possible departure dates on a calendar is genuinely useful, *especially with
  no arrival chosen* (discovery: you're picking where to go, and the calendar of feasible
  days is valuable). So it is never deleted.
- But if you've just selected a date, **hide it by default** (collapsed, one tap to
  reveal/change) so it doesn't feel like the date was asked twice.
- Net: date selected → calendar collapsed by default (expandable to change the day / see
  all possible dates); no destination / discovery → calendar shown (it's the useful tool).

**Ticket flow = the multi-legs pattern (David likes it).** Select a time (outbound), then
select a time (return), and it **combines into one full travel-flow recap**, exactly like
the multi-city legs view. So don't fight the accordion — make the round trip use the same
"pick each leg's time → combine → see the whole trip" flow the multi-legs already has, and
end on a combined recap/booking screen.

### SHIPPED — the "How long?" stay control + linked calendars (this section's spec)

Implemented the spec below. What landed:

- **"How long?" stay control** (`src/ui/form.ts`, `TripShape = "oneway" | StayChoice`): a
  wrapping chip row **Just going · Same day · 1 night · 2 · 3 · Flexible** (duration/intent
  framing, not "one-way / round trip" jargon — David's refinement), beside the date. It is
  the whole trip-type choice; `query.stay: StayChoice` replaces the old `tripShape` flag.
  `r` steps through the chips. The glossary blurb is deleted everywhere.
- **Linked calendars** (`runTripSearch`): clicking a departure day restarts the return
  calendar from it (fixed stay → departure + N; else same-day-first); the return is
  auto-derived for a fixed stay and adjustable on the calendar.
- **No scroll-up on a calendar tap**: `revealElement()` only ever scrolls DOWN to genuinely
  below-fold new content; the return-day pick updates in place; `updateUrl` preserves the
  history-state form snapshot.
- **Obvious booking**: per-leg "Book the outbound" / "Book the return" in the trip recap
  (`render.tripViewEl`) + a "booked separately" note.
- **Efficient results**: results title tightened + hidden on mobile (the search bar carries
  the route/dates), glossary removed.
- **Step-wise Back** (`activeStepBack`): Back re-opens the outbound (and walks the multi-city
  legs) before exiting the flow; integrated with `goBack` + Escape.
- **State preservation**: a form snapshot rides each history entry (`store.pushUrl/updateUrl`
  `state`), restored on `popstate`; the saved page pushes an entry so gesture-Back closes it.
- **Zero truncation (FR ≤360px)**: advanced field labels wrap; long-value selects
  (connections, region, type) span the full grid width; the stay chips wrap.
- **Minimise clicks**: picking a stay chip re-runs in place (no second Search tap); the
  outbound calendar mirrors the form date (never re-asked); a one-way list books on tap.
  Core round-trip decision path ≈ 5 taps: stay chip → outbound → return → Book outbound →
  Book return (each leg is a separate SNCF Connect search; a through-ticket can't be
  deep-linked). Accepting the pre-highlighted defaults collapses outbound + return to one
  tap each.

Original spec (kept for the record):

### SUPERSEDED after testing — a single "How long?" control + linked calendars

David tested the fully-merged single-return-calendar flow and it was NOT intuitive: you
couldn't easily choose how long to stay, and explaining day-vs-round in a text blurb was a
smell. New confirmed direction (this supersedes the MERGE section below):

- **One "How long?" control** up front is the whole choice: **Same day · 1 night · 2 · 3 ·
  Flexible**. Same day = day trip (hours on site); N nights = round trip with that stay;
  Flexible = pick the return day on the return calendar. This replaces the One-way/Round-trip
  segments' day-vs-round ambiguity with an explicit, intuitive stay length. (One-way stays a
  separate choice — e.g. the tab / a "one-way" option.)
- **Departure calendar** (Ulysse-style): pick when to go and see how many options each day
  has (availability count per day). Selectable early.
- **Linked calendars**: clicking a departure day **updates the return calendar to start from
  that day** (departure + N nights, or a full return calendar when Flexible). "Click the
  first cell, it updates the other."
- **Delete the "Aller-retour ou journée ?" glossary blurb** — the control makes it
  self-evident; make the distinction real in the UI, not in explanatory text.
- Also fix: French field labels / select options that clip on mobile (wrap them — ZERO
  truncation), and losing departure/destination when navigating back (persist form state
  across popstate / browser-back, not just the in-app back button).
- **Step-wise back inside multi-step flows.** In the round-trip accordion, pressing Back
  after selecting the outbound must return to STEP 1 (re-open / change the outbound), not
  exit the whole flow. Audit for similar cases (multi-city legs, any accordion/stepper) and
  make Back walk the steps backward before leaving the flow.
- **No scroll-up on a calendar tap** (David: "clicking on a date on the calendar scrolls
  up, why?"). Tapping a calendar day must update the results IN PLACE without jerking the
  page/drawer up. The current `refreshInPlace` scroll-restore / `revealResults` / focus logic
  causes a jump — a calendar tap should keep the calendar where it is; only gently reveal
  genuinely-new content (e.g. the return leg the first time it appears), never scroll up.
- **Efficient results screen** (David: "this screen is not efficient"). The results view
  wastes vertical space: the big heading DUPLICATES the collapsed search bar (both read
  "Paris ⇄ Lyon · dates"), and the "Aller-retour ou journée ?" blurb + guide link + "Départ
  · Changer" push the first train far down. Drop the duplicated heading (the search bar
  already carries it, or make one of them minimal), delete the glossary blurb, and tighten
  the chrome so an actual train is visible with little/no scrolling.

### Round-trip verdict: MERGE (matches David's direction) — SUPERSEDED, see above

Day trip is literally a 0-night round trip. Collapse the segments to **One-way / Round
trip**. Ask the **departure date once** (form). Build **one return calendar starting at
`query.date`** so its first cell is same-day (reuse the day-trip same-day feasibility
filter); a 0-night cell shows hours-on-site, later cells show nights. Day vs round is then
self-evident from the cell you tap — no separate mode. Keep a **compact outbound
day-switcher** (David: quick date change has value) rather than a full duplicate calendar.
The trip modal becomes a **confirmation/booking** screen: one "Book this leg" primary per
leg, direct trains deep-link straight (no nested modal).

### Prioritized work list

1. `queryIsRenderable(q)` for the mobile screen decision everywhere + real titles → kills
   the "MAX Finder" dead screen. `[M]`
2. Preserve form state across navigation: `navStack` carries `{query, form}`; restore the
   live form in `goBack`. `[M]`
3. Merge day→round: One-way/Round-trip, one return calendar with same-day first cell. `[L]`
4. Ticket flow → confirmation/booking screen, one Book per leg. `[L]`
5. Map: asymmetric pixel padding reserving the drawer height. `[S]`
6. Mobile feedback: `refreshInPlace` scrolls `.drawer-scroll` + auto-scroll to the count. `[S]`
7. Truncated names: `.dest-meta` wraps; full truncation sweep at 390px. `[S]`
8. One save system (retire favorites into saved-trips). `[M]`
9. One `openRoute(o,d,{run})` primitive + one back-button helper + real history for detail pages. `[M]`
10. One home for the availability calendar. `[M]`
11. Minor de-dup: `allDaysLinkEl` helper, Surprise/Nearest, legs-clear label, one book affordance/card. `[M]`

## How this is tracked
